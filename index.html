                        <h3>Multiple Meaning of Projection Mapping</h3>
                        <p>
                            The term <b><i>mapping</i></b> highlights the role of space in the context of visual art as this term includes a function – real time projections adjusted to spatial objects.
                        </p>
    
                        <small>
                            The term <i><b>mapping</b></i> is also used in the computer sphere, for example, aligning peripherals with software parameters. It is possible to write on a personal computer’s screen due to the mapping of the keyboard with software functionality.
                        </small>

                        <p>
                            <i><b>Projection mapping</b></i> or real time projections adjusted to spatial objects is a recently created set of electronic audio visual media methods which allows to surpass standard-size projections multiplying the picture, as well as to adjust the picture for different surfaces.

                        <h3>A brief history</h3>
                        <blockquote><small>
                            While projection mapping has recently exploded into the consciousness of artists and advertisers everywhere, the history of projection mapping dates back longer than you may imagine.
                            <br> <br>
                            If you try Googling for “Projection Mapping” you won’t find anything older than 3 years. That is because projection mapping’s older, academic name is “Spatial Augmented Reality”. The field is also known as “video mapping”, but projection mapping seems to be winning out in the United States.
                            <br> <br>
                            For the purposes of this history, I’m only including work that considered projection onto an arbitrarily complex surfaces. Projection onto flat and cylindrical/spherical surfaces has a much older history and goes back to the invention of cinema.

                        <h3>Inventions chronologically</h3>
                          <small>
                            <li> The first known instance of projection onto a non-flat surface dates back to the 1969 opening of the Haunted Mansion ride in Disneyland. These were accomplished by filming head-shots of the singers (with 16 mm film) and then projecting this film onto busts of their faces.</li><br>
                            <li> The next projection mapping instance comes in 1980, with the immersive film installation Displacements by Michael Naimark. In this art installation a living room with two performers were filmed with a rotating camera, then the camera was replaced with a projector. The result is rotating projection mapping.</li><br>
                            <li> Disney not only pioneered the technology of projection mapping, they also made the earliest patent in the space in 1991. Entitled “Apparatus and method for projection upon a three-dimensional object“. It essentially describes a system for digitally painting an image onto “a countoured, three-dimensional object.”</li>

                          <small>
                            <li> In 1994, GE also has an early patent for a “A system and method for precisely superimposing images of computer models in three-dimensional space to a corresponding physical object in physical space.”</li><br>
                            <li>1998. Projection mapping really started to get traction when it was pursued in academia. “Spatial Augmented Reality” was born out of the work by at UNC Chapel Hill by Ramesh Raskar, Greg Welch, Henry Fuchs and Deepak Bandyopadhyay. It all got started with a paper The Office of the Future. The Office of the Future envisioned a world where projectors could cover any surface. Instead of staring at a small computer monitor, we would be able to experience augmented reality right from our desk. This means we could Skype with life-size versions of our office mates, view life-size virtual 3D models. This work even featured an early real-time, imperceptible 3D scanner (like the Kinect).</li>

But before that, he pioneered some of the early work in interactive projection mapping. He introduced the concept of the I/O Bulb (Input/Output Bulb), namely a projector coupled with a camera that could one be as ubiqitous as a traditional light bulb.</li><br>
                            <li> In 2001 Raskar continued with interactive projections and paintings on still and moving objects.</li><br>
                            <li>in 2004. From there Raskar went on to explore moveable projectors (predicting the pico projectors of the future). These hand-held smart-projectors are aware of their position and orientation through a variety of sensors. They demonstrated using smart projectors to aid in warehouse inventory and maintenance.</li><br>

                        <h3>Why It Has Been Invented?</h3>
                        <blockquote><small>
                            The reason why the projection mapping technique (as we know it today) was invented and developed further was a problem when there was no place for a screen at an event venue. The projector could also be put in a place somewhere in the room where the beam of light breaks partially on the ceiling, partially on one wall and plus on some other surface, thus being absolutely useless. There was no appropriate software at that time yet and specialists of the field worked out – if gamers had various advanced possibilities for using a room in 3D environment then VJs could use it dividing the room by walls and thus providing a more in-depth overview – getting beyond the classic rectangular screen.

                            Starting from 2011 commercial companies have started to develop the projection mapping as a serious, progressive technology. Nowadays if you are skilled enough you can make your own app and use it in your work and share it with others.

                                Back to the first type it should be noted that when making projections for certain surfaces, the work is first done in 3D and animation software — classical animation methods are applied, such as lightning and special effects, narrative. The most classic example is projection mapping on architectural facades used at light festivals. The buildings are modeled first (or ready-made, modeled prototypes of them are used) and the story is created taking into consideration the design of the particular building. The process is connected with very accurate work where each mistake (let it be no more than a millimeter) both, in animation process or in the projection on the particular surface can be seen as a bias which looks like a defect. Therefore this process cannot be associated with real time performance.

                            <li>Blender is a free and open source 3D modelling suite. It supports modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users can code in Python to customize the application.</li>
                            <li>The first version of Blender has been released in the summer of 2000</li>
                            <li>Blender is cross-platform and runs equally well on Linux, Windows and Mac computers</li>

                            <li>A set of patches can be combined in a macro patch. Macro patches can be placed in various hierarchies and can be edited.</li>
                            <li>In Quartz Composer you can combine graphical and non-graphical technologies - Quartz 2D, Core Image, Core Video, OpenGL, QuickTime, MIDI, System Services and XML.</li>

                            <li>Go to <u>Inspector › Settings</u> to define the equation</li>

                            <li>There is one single output that is called <u>Result</u></li>
                            <li>You can use more predefined mathematical and programmatical functions like ceil(), floor(), rand(), log(), etc.</li>

                            <li>A replicator, used as a macro patch - that means that you have to double click an instance of it and place your logic inside.</li>

                            <li>Inside the Iterator patch you would use the <u>Iterator Variables</u> patch to get the <u>number of assigned iterations</u> and <u>current iteration index</u>.</li>
                            <li>You can publish more inputs from within the Iterator patch to use the parameters along with Iterator Variables.</li>

                        <p>The surface for projection mapping has it's story on it's own. It has been created in Blender and then made real with the help of a lasercutter.</p>

                        <p>Use <a href="http://hv-a.com/lpmt/">LPMT</a> or <a href="http://hcgilje.wordpress.com/vpt/">VPT</a> instead if you like free software.</p>
